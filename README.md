## About

This is a sample project I put together to try out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). You can find the latest deployment at https://web-dev-test-app.vercel.app/

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The tech stack is...
1. Next.js
2. React
3. Prisma
4. PostgreSQL
5. Vercel for deployment

## Getting Started

Currently I don't have a local setup for the database, you need to grab the env from the Vercel project to connect to the public DB.

If you've got the environment setup, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
